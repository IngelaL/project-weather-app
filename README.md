# Weather App

This weeks project was to build a responsive weather app by using API.

## The problem

I had short time to work on this project this week but I managed to do the blue level. I fetched external data from weather API:s, to my website. I also manipulated the DOM in javascript to show information in my weather app. If I had more time I would have added images and favourite cities.
