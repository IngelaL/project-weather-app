# Weather App

This weeks project was to build a responsive weather app by using API.

## The problem

I had short time to work on this project this week but I managed to do the blue level. I fetched external data from weather API:s, to my website. I also manipulated the DOM in javascript to show information in my weather app. If I had more time I would have added images and favourite cities.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
